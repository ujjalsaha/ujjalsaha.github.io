    <span class="guideline_header;" style="text-align: center">Narrative Visualization Walkthrough - Demonstrating Interactive Slideshow using COVID-19 Dataset for United States</span><br/>
    This is a demonstration of Narrative Visualisation using the Interactive Slideshow Structure using the COVID-19 Dataset of United States and tries to establish sequence of hierarchies putting forward the observation in terms of various Scenes as pages. The narrative visualization mainly explore the overall cases and new cases of COVID-19 pandemic within united states and how each state is affected in terms of case counts.
    This whole Visualization is based on four Scenes. .
    <p>
        <span class="bold">Scenes:</span><br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1. <span class="bold">Scene 1 (United States - COVID-19 Until April 2020):</span> where author presents the situation with new cases and overall cases on the states of United States until April 2020 and being within scene1 lets user explore with the User controls. With help of annotations, author also presents critical observations.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;2. <span class="bold">Scene 2 (United States - COVID-19 Until May 2020):</span>  where author presents the situation with new cases and overall cases on the states of United States until May 2020 and being within scene2 lets user explore with the User controls. With help of annotations, author also presents critical observations.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;3. <span class="bold">Scene 3 (United States - COVID-19 Until June 2020):</span>  where author presents the situation with new cases and overall cases on the states of United States until Jun 2020 and being within scene3 lets user explore with the User controls. With help of annotations, author also presents critical observations.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;4. <span class="bold">Scene 4 (United States - COVID-19 Until July 2020):</span>  where author presents the situation with new cases and overall cases on the states of United States until July 2020 and being within scene1 lets user explore with the User controls. With help of annotations, author also presents critical observations. Author also makes some conclusion as this is the final scene.<br/>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">Parameters and Triggers:  </span><br/>
        The scence changes from slide to slide based on the parameters such as date, overall cases and new cases. The slide button triggers the change in parameters that brings up a new scene each time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">Navigation with the Scenes: </span><br>
        In this narrative visualization, each scene is presented as individual slide containing 4 charts. Couple of charts (Map and Line chart) representing COVID-19 new cases and other couple of charts (Map and Line Chart) representing CONVID-19 overall cases.
        Below section has the buttons that changes scenes. To move to next scene/slides/pages, click the button left to right in order. Every time a button is pressed to change a scene, the selected button will turn Gray in color and other buttons will remain Brown color. For best experience of the narrative visualisation, it is highly recommended to browse the slides in order, and not to jump slides.

      2. These are public data set downloaded as freely available on the above sites. No further verification and validation process have been carried out.<br/>
      3. Start date for the entire narrative visualization has been fixed to Mar 16, as before Mar16 the data was inconsistent as few states weren't able to report data before Mar 16.<br/>
      4. Only 52 States of United Sates haven been considered for this narrative visualization. Union Territory and other territories haven't been considered in this analysis.<br/>
      5. Data only until Jul 24, 2020 are present on the dataset that was used for this narrative visualization.<br/>
